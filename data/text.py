Thinner bill than Red-winged Blackbird. Found in wooded swamps. Often in flocks; frequently mixes with Red-winged Blackbirds and Common Grackle in winter. Look for flocks perched at tops of trees bordering marshes and listen for their calls to help pick them out from large flocks of blackbirds.",
            "Yellow-headed blackbirds have a large head with a sharply pointed bill, a long tail, and a stout body. Males are black with yellow heads and chests, and white patches where their wings bend. Females and immature males are generally gray-brown with a duller yellow head. Both male and female birds grow to 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 centimeters) long with a 15-inch (38-centimeter) average wingspan.",
            "Fluttering over hayfields and meadows in summer, the male of this species produces a bubbling, tinkling song, after which it is named. The male is easily distinguished in its spring finery and is the only North American bird with a white back and black undersides (which could be described as wearing a tuxedo backwards). Before the fall migration he molts and takes on a striped brown appearance similar to the female. bobolinks with this plumage were once called 'ricebirds' in the south, occasionally causing serious damage in this area in the rice fields.",

Males in their breeding plumage have a brilliant jewel-like coloring that makes them a favorite among birdwatchers. Vibrant shades of blue cover their bodies, with slightly darker blues on their head. Wingtips and tails are blackish. Females, however, are mostly brown with white undersides and faint brown streaks on the breast. Males lose their breeding color during the fall and take on the brown coloration of females. Both sexes have short, cone-shaped beaks and dark gray legs.",
            "Male Lazuli Buntings in breeding plumage are striking, blue birds with rufous breasts. They have black wings and tails, and white bellies. They look similar to Western Bluebirds, but are smaller, and have two white wing-bars on each wing. They also have thicker bills than bluebirds. First-year males look similar to mature males, but have a brownish wash. Females look like unstreaked sparrows: they are buffy-brown all over, with two narrow, white wing-bars on each wing.",
            "The male Painted bunting has been nicknamed nonpareil, or 'without equal'. Its colors, dark blue head, green back, red rump, and underparts, make it extremely easy to identify, but it can still be difficult to spot since it often skulks in foliage even when it is singing. The plumage of female and juvenile painted buntings is green and yellow-green, serving as camouflage. Once seen, the adult female is still distinctive, since it is a brighter, truer green than other similar songbirds. The juveniles have two inserted molts in their first autumn, each yielding plumage like an adult female. The first starts a few days after fledging, replacing the juvenile plumage with an auxiliary formative plumage; and the second a month or so later giving the formative plumage.",
            "Northern cardinals are medium-sized songbirds. Both males and females have thick, bright orange, cone-shaped beaks. They also have a long tail and a pointed crest of feathers on the top of their heads. Males are bright red all over except for a large, black mask on their face. The mask covers their eyes, goes around their beaks, and covers their throats so that it looks like a black bib. Females are light brown with a reddish crest, wings, and tails. Females have a very small, black mask and bib. Males are slightly larger than females. Young cardinals look similar to females, but they have a gray-black bill and have less red coloration.",
            "Chunky rainforest bird with emerald green upperparts, black spot below the dark red eye, and green-olive underparts with extensive pale spotting. Inhabits the Wet Tropics of northern Queensland (Cairns region), thus does not overlap with similar Green Catbird. Forages mostly in middle and upper story of the rainforest. Compare female and juvenile Satin Bowerbird (with blue eye, darker bill). Spotted Catbird is well known for its characteristic catlike yowling call.",
            "Medium-sized songbird, smaller than a robin, with a smooth gray body, black cap, and rusty-red undertail. Sometimes mimics other species in complex, jumbled song. Prefers dense shrubs and small trees in forest edges, streamside thickets, and old fields. Occasionally feeds on suet.",
            "Strange, long-tailed tanager-like bird with thick bill. Once thought to be a warbler, but now considered unique in its own family. Bright yellow throat and breast, contrasting white spectacles, and dull olive-green upperparts. Known for its skulking habits. Often difficult to see in dense thickets, shrubby areas, and field edges. In breeding season, however, males can sit on conspicuous perches to sing and even perform a flight display. Fairly widespread but typically uncommon across much of the U.S. and Mexico, wintering to Costa Rica. Song is variable series of slow whistles, hoots, and chatters. Feeds mainly on insects; also fruit in winter.",
            "Large, striking, long-tailed sparrow of the eastern U.S. and Canada. Black above with bright rufous sides and a white belly. Eye color varies from white (in the southeastern U.S) to dark red (further north). In flight, note white corners on tail. Also note females are browner than jet-black males. Most similar to Spotted Towhee, but Eastern is mostly black above, only showing single white patch on folded wing. Hybridizes with Spotted Towhee in central U.S. and south-central Canada; hybrids usually show intermediate wing pattern. Inhabits scrubby areas and forest edges with thickets. Forages primarily by hopping along ground, scraping away leaf litter. Males sing from atop shrubs and low trees. Visits feeders.",
            "Large night bird with a remarkably big head. Plumage is variable, ranging from grayish to strikingly rufous, but always intricately patterned. Very similar to Whip-poor-will but larger, longer-winged, and more rufous. Chuck-will’s-widow has less white in the tail than Whip-poor-will, but can be difficult to see. Strictly nocturnal, more often heard than seen. Listen for a loud whistled song calling its name: 'chuck-WILL'S-widow.' Sometimes found roosting on low branches during the daytime, especially during migration. Found in forests with mix of pines and deciduous trees.",
            "Brandt’s cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) is one of 40 species of large seabirds from the family Phalacrocoracidae. The average Brandt’s cormorant stands 79 cm tall, about the size of a typical human toddler, with a wingspan twice as wide as the bird is tall. Juveniles exhibit brown and grey plumage and brown eyes. Adults have black feathers and blue-green irises. In breeding season, a pouch beneath the throat called a gular pouch becomes distinctly blue, along with blue and green tints amid the black plumage. The blue gular pouch distinguishes the Brandt’s cormorant from pelagic cormorants (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), which are of similar plumage but slightly smaller in size.",
            "Dark glossy-green cormorant with a bluish neck, red face, and yellowish bill. White patches on sides of rump. Juveniles are duller than adults, especially on the face, but usually show some pale pinkish at the base of the bill. Found on rocky coastlines; breeds in colonies on precarious cliff faces. Range extends from the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, out the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands to the Kamchatcka Peninsula, and down the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido. Most similar to Pelagic Cormorant but note thicker neck, brighter face, and thicker, paler bill. Feeds on fish.",
            "A small, slender cormorant with a thin, dark bill. Blackish overall with glossy green head and body and purplish neck. Breeding adults have white patches on sides of rump and limited reddish face. Strictly coastal, where it nests on cliffs. Dives to capture fish. Smaller than Brandt’s or Red-faced Cormorants, with a more slender neck and a thinner dark bill. Fairly extensive range along west coast of North America and in East Asia.",
            "Dark brown to matte black; males with iridescent bluish wings. Thick neck and heavy bill. Look for vampire-like staring red eye. Males have an incredible display where they puff out a mane of neck feathers and hover in a circle above the female. Found in a variety of open or semi-open areas, including pastures, forest edge, yards, and agricultural areas. Visits feeders. Often in flocks, sometimes with other blackbirds.",
            "Common in Caribbean and South America. Found in semiopen and open grassy areas, often associated with livestock. Feeds mainly on the ground, but perches readily in bushes and trees. Male is glossy blue-black overall (often looks simply black). Female is plain grayish-brown overall. Bill shape is the key feature: blackish bill is more slender and pointed than bills of Brown-headed and Bronzed cowbirds. Also note similar but larger Melodious Blackbird, which has longer bill and often flicks its tail.",
            "Brown Creepers are tiny woodland birds with an affinity for the biggest trees they can find. Look for these little, long-tailed scraps of brown and white spiraling up stout trunks and main branches, sometimes passing downward-facing nuthatches along the way. They probe into crevices and pick at loose bark with their slender, downcurved bills, and build their hammock-shaped nests behind peeling flakes of bark. Their piercing calls can make it much easier to find this hard-to-see but common species.",
            "This is the common crow over much of the U.S. and Canada. Most easily identified by voice, a familiar “caw,” often repeated. Common in any open habitats, including fields, open woodlands, marshes, and cities, thriving around humans. Very social, usually seen in flocks, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or even thousands. Aggressive, sometimes seen chasing away hawks and owls. Separated from ravens by smaller size, smaller bill, shorter tail, and shorter, broader wings. Compare with Fish Crow, which is extremely similar in appearance, and best separated by voice. Includes the species formerly known as Northwestern Crow.",
            "A relatively small, glossy crow. Very difficult to separate from American Crow by appearance; look for Fish Crow’s slightly more tapered wings, quicker wingbeats, and shorter legs. Most easily identified by voice, a nasal “eh-uh” or single nasal caws. Mostly restricted to the southeastern U.S., especially along the coast, but range expanding slightly northward and inland in recent years. Often near water, but also seems especially fond of fast-food parking lots and dumpsters.",
            "Slender, long-tailed bird more often heard than seen. White below and brown above, with black bill. Separated from Yellow-billed Cuckoo by bill color, uniformly brown outer wings (not rufous) and smaller white spots on underside of tail. Feeds mainly on caterpillars and other insects.

Listen for its song, a repeated series of soft 'cu-cu-cu' notes.",
            "Slender, long-tailed bird found in shrubby woodland (especially mangroves). Brown above and buffy below with gray cap, black mask, and bold black-and-white pattern on underside of tail. Bill is black on top, yellow below. Similar to Yellow-billed Cuckoo, but note buffy belly, black mask, and no rufous in the wings. Shy; tends to sit still for long periods of time, can be difficult to spot. Song is a series of low croaking notes, gradually becoming longer and lower-pitched. Feeds primarily on insects and small reptiles.",
            "Slender, long-tailed bird that is more often heard than seen. Brown above and white below, with a yellow bill. Look for the large white spots on underside of tail. Wings flash rufous, especially obvious in flight. Stealthy and shy in dense forests and riparian areas, often sitting motionless for long periods of time. Feeds mainly on caterpillars and other insects. Uncommon but widespread breeder across much of North America; more southerly distribution than Black-billed Cuckoo. Winters in South America, where care should be taken to separate from very similar Pearly-breasted Cuckoo, which lacks rufous tones in wing. Separated from Black-billed Cuckoo by bill color, wing color, and tail pattern. Listen for its hoarse cooing song and knocking calls.",
            "The most widespread rosy-finch. Body is the color of milk chocolate. Look for pink highlights in the wings, tail and belly. Several different populations; some have gray wrapping around the back of the head only above the eye, others have entirely gray cheek. Breeds at the highest elevations; descends to lower elevations in winter. Often in mixed flocks in winter with other rosy-finches. Feeds on seeds and insects. Look for them foraging on alpine snowfields. Visits feeders, primarily in winter.",

Also note large black crescent-shaped mark on breast. Wings and tail flash yellow or red, depending on the subspecies. Generally 'Yellow-shafted' is found in eastern and northern North America, and 'Red-shafted' is found in western North America as far south as Oaxaca. Birds from Chiapas to Nicaragua are larger with entirely brown crown, sometimes considered a separate species. Typically singly or in pairs, but can gather in large loose groups during migration and winter. Often seen feeding on the ground in open areas, foraging for ants and worms. Vocal and conspicuous: listen for loud “kleer!” call and series of laughing notes.",
            "Small flycatcher with big peaked head and relatively long bill. Extremely similar to several other species, especially Alder and Willow Flycatchers. Greenish-olive above and pale whitish below. Note thin white eyering and very long wingtips. Best distinguished from other flycatchers by habitat and voice. Birds near the northern end of breeding range prefer shaded ravines with mix of hemlocks and deciduous trees; farther south, found in mature deciduous forests. Tends to stay high in the canopy. Song is an explosive “pwit-SIP!,” call note is a sharp “pweek!”",
            "Fairly large flycatcher of mature forests. Relatively bright and richly colored for a Myiarchus flycatcher; especially note bright yellow belly, grayish throat and breast, and dull pinkish base to the lower mandible. Most easily identified by voice: listen for loud, rising “queeEEEP” and various rolling, burry calls. Breeds in deciduous forests throughout eastern North America; winters as far south as northern South America. Compare especially with Brown-crested Flycatcher on the wintering grounds.",
            "Small, grayish-olive flycatcher; very similar to several other species. Look for relatively bold white eyeing, small bill, and frequent wing flicking. Most easily identified by voice: song is a loud “che-BEK, che-BEK” often repeated in bursts. Also gives a short, dry “whit” call. Found in a variety of wooded or shrubby habitats, often near water during breeding season. Typically solitary, often flitting around actively when foraging.",
            "Stocky flycatcher that almost always perches conspicuously on a high bare perch with an upright posture. From the front, look for dark sides creating a vest, with a bright white stripe from throat to belly. White patches on the sides of rump are sometimes visible from behind. Most similar to pewees but larger and larger-billed, with more contrasting vest. Feeds on insects. Breeds in clearings and bogs in boreal or mountainous forests, but can be found in migration in open habitats with a mixture of woods and clearings. Distinctive whistled song is often likened to 'quick, three beers;' also listen for 'pip' call notes.",
            "Large flycatcher with an extremely long, forked tail. Pale gray overall with darker wings and a salmon-colored wash on the belly. In flight, look for brighter salmon underwings. Juveniles are duller and shorter-tailed than adults, but still distinctive. Breeds in open country of Texas and neighboring states, where it is often seen on fenceposts and utility wires. Winters mainly on the Pacific coast of Mexico and Central America, where it sometimes gathers in large flocks. Might be confused with Fork-tailed Flycatcher in winter range, but note paler plumage with salmon underwings.",

Females and immature males are much duller grayish-brown, but usually show pink or yellowish color on belly. Widespread; occurs from the southwest U.S. to Argentina. Found in many open woodlands and brushy areas, often seen perched on fence posts along roadsides. Feeds on insects.",
            "Small flycatcher, extremely similar to several other species. Generally shy and inconspicuous; breeds in spruce forests often near boggy areas. Migrants tend to be found in denser wet areas within woods. Olive-greenish above with distinctive yellow wash on throat and belly. Black wings with bold white wingbars. Nearly identical to Pacific-slope and Cordilleran Flycatchers, but no range overlap. Within range, main confusion species is Least Flycatcher. Bright yellow throat and belly is usually enough to identify Yellow-bellied Flycatcher, but some worn birds can be very similar. Song is similar to Least Flycatcher but more slurred, with a soft buzzy tone. Not frequently repeated like Least Flycatcher. Soft whistled call note, pwee, unlike Least's sharp whit call.",
            "The Magnificent frigatebird is a large, lightly built seabird with brownish-black plumage, long narrow wings and a deeply forked tail. The male has a striking red gular sac which it inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a white breast and belly. Knowing for their interesting feeding behavior, frigatebirds take fish in flight from the ocean's surface (often flying fish), and sometimes indulge in kleptoparasitism, harassing other birds to force them to regurgitate their food.",
            "The Northern Fulmar is similar in appearance to a gull but stockier, with a thick neck, and more rounded wings and tail. The Northern Fulmar varies in color from mostly white, to gray and white like many gulls, to an overall gray-brown, with every possible shade in between.",

Adult males in spring and summer are bright yellow with black forehead and wings. Females are dull yellow below and olive above with two distinct wingbars. In winter, they are drab, buffy-brown. Active and acrobatic. Sometimes in large numbers at feeders or on ground below. Found in weedy fields, cultivated areas, roadsides, orchards, and backyards.",
            "Beautiful little finch with a sharp pink bil, cherry-red face, and brilliant black-and-yellow flashes in the wings. Western birds (Europe east to far western Central Asia) have a black-and-white cowl; eastern birds (rest of Central Asia) lack this cowl, and are grayer overall, with more white on the wing. Juvenile (seen in late summer and autumn) has a plain head but is told easily by bold wing pattern. Uses a wide array of wooded and open habitats, from forests and gardens to steppe grasslands and meadows; often feeds on seeding thistles. Forms flocks in autumn and winter, gathering at food sources. Can be inconspicuous, but often detected by pleasant bubbling and twittering calls and song.",
            "Large, lanky blackbird with rounded crown and long tail. Males have ridiculously long tails, almost as long as their body, often held in a V-shape like the keel of boat. Males are glossy black. Females are brown, with subtle face pattern. Eye color ranges from brown along western Gulf Coast to yellow on Atlantic Coast. Strictly coastal, except in Florida where they occur inland (often around human development). Overlaps with similar Great-tailed Grackle on Texas coast, but occurs more strictly in coastal saltmarshes and has dark eye (not pale).",
            "Small, compact grebe with thin pointed bill. Breeding adults mostly black with chestnut flanks; look for wispy golden plumes on cheek and peaked head shape. In winter, grayish overall with a dark cap blending into the dark cheek, and a smudgy dark neck. Red eye visible at close range. Breeds on marshy ponds and lakes; during migration and winter, often seen on large lakes, bays, and open ocean. Compare with Horned Grebe, especially in winter. Eared is thinner-necked and smaller-headed, with more peaked crown, darker cheek, and no pale tip on bill.",

Takes four years for immatures to progress from mostly brown to fully white and gray adult plumage; intermediate plumages are often mottled and messy. Most immatures look frosty grayish-brown with smooth patterning. Found in coastal areas, including beaches, mudflats, and even city parks. Identification is complicated by frequent hybridization with Western, Herring, and Glaucous Gulls in various parts of range. Pure birds can be difficult to find and identify with certainty, and many intermediate birds are best left unidentified.",
            "Unique smoky-gray gull with red bill. Breeding adults have a clean white head that blends seamlessly into the gray neck; nonbreeding adults have smudgy dark streaking on the head. Immatures are entirely dark brown with a yellowish or reddish bill with a dark tip. Almost exclusively coastal; usually seen in flocks loafing on beaches or feeding in nearshore waters. Breeds in Mexico mainly in the Gulf of California; migrates as far north as Washington and British Columbia in winter. Overall dark plumage of immatures might recall a dark-morph jaeger; note Heermann's lacks pale wing flashes and never shows pale mottling on the belly or underwings.",

Takes four years for immatures to progress from mostly brown to fully white and gray adult plumage; intermediate plumages are often mottled and messy. Extremely variable plumage is compounded by several different subspecies across range. Usually shows a dull pinkish base to the bill by the first winter, and develops a pale eye by the second winter. Some immature birds can fade to almost white, especially in their first or second summer, but they always show darker wingtips. Occurs inland and along the coast, frequenting fishing boats, beaches, lakes, and landfills. Often forms large flocks with other gulls.",
            "A spectacular and highly sought-after Arctic gull. Unmistakable in all plumages. Adults are entirely gleaming white with black legs and a bluish-green bill with an orange tip. Immatures have a dark face and variable black spotting on the wings and tail. Stocky and short-legged, suggesting an odd white pigeon as much as a typical gull. Almost always restricted to icy areas in the High Arctic, very rarely wandering further south in the winter. Can be seen singly or in loose groups, especially when feeding at a seal carcass. Typically very confiding.",

Takes four years for immatures to progress from mostly brown to fully white and gray adult plumage; intermediate plumages are often mottled and messy. Starts to develop dark gray back in second year. At all ages, look for overall stocky shape and large bill. Strictly coastal, occurring along beaches and bays along the Pacific coast. Commonly seen around coastal towns and cities, but almost never ventures inland. Identification is muddied by frequent hybridization, especially with Glaucous-winged Gull at the northern end of its range. Hybrids can show any mix of intermediate traits; some are best left unidentified.",
            "Relatively large-headed and chunky. Gray and green overall, lacking buffy or orangey tones. Males have shocking magenta head, which appears dark when not catching the light. Females have dingy grayish underparts and often show a dark patch in the center of the throat. Note relatively short, straight bill compared with Black-chinned or Costa’s Hummingbird. Common year-round in the Pacific states of the U.S., mainly in relatively open or scrubby habitats including desert scrub and chaparral.

Female has whitish underparts with almost no buffy tones (perhaps a very light wash on flanks). Readily comes to sugar water feeders and flower gardens. Default summer hummingbird over most of eastern U.S. and Canada. Winters south to Panama. Very difficult to distinguish from Black-chinned Hummingbird, especially females and young males; thankfully limited range overlap. Ruby-throated averages somewhat brighter green above, shorter- and straighter-billed, and has slightly narrower outer wing feathers, but these differences are all extremely subtle.",
            "Adult males are almost entirely orange with bright white chest and some green on the back (can be solid green like Allen's Hummingbird). Throat is iridescent, and depending on the light, can look anywhere from red to orange to yellow to lime green. On females and immatures, look for orange on sides and tail to separate from Anna's and Black-chinned. Found in a variety of wooded habitats; more common in migration in suburbs, meadows, and other brushier areas. Feeds on nectar and tiny insects.",
            "Rather large, overall bright green hummingbird of highlands. Favors pine-oak forest and edge, especially overgrown clearings and roadsides with dense flower banks. Fairly common and is especially conspicuous when singing. Song is a jerky, metallic, chipping song given tirelessly from an exposed twig at middle to upper levels in trees. When feeding often stays fairly well hidden within flowers. Note overall deep green plumage with dark violet cheek and breast patches, and broad dark tail band.",
            "Slender gull-like seabird; the smallest of the three jaegers. Breeds on Arctic tundra; spends the rest of the year at sea. Difficult to separate from other jaegers, especially Parasitic.

Breeding adults are unique with elongated spoon-shaped central tail feathers. Also note blackish-brown upperparts, messy black cap that extends below the bill, and extensive white flash on upper and underside of outerwing. Rare dark morph adult is entirely blackish-brown but still has white wing flashes. Immature birds are variable, but in general, they are barred with brown above and have bold black-and-white bars on the underwing and undertail coverts. Difficult to separate from other jaegers, especially Parasitic. At all ages, note powerful direct flight and broad wings. Typically shows white shafts on six to eight outer wing feathers (more than other jaegers) and more obvious white flash on underwing. Bill is also thicker than other jaegers. All jaegers chase other birds and steal their food.",

Subspecies include: Slate-colored (widespread), Oregon (West), Pink-sided (Rockies), Gray-headed (Rockies and southwest U.S. to Mexico), Red-backed (central Arizona and New Mexico), and White-winged (breeds in Black Hills, winters mainly Colorado).",
            "Large, ubiquitous yellow-bellied flycatcher found throughout most of Middle and South America, though tends to be uncommon at the far northern end of its range in the U.S. A classic “telephone wire” bird along roadsides and in towns. Prefers open areas with some trees and water. Most abundant in lowlands and foothills, but ventures up to over 3,000m in some parts of range. Listen for sharp, high-pitched twitters. Nearly identical to Couch’s Kingbird, which overlaps from Texas to Belize; best separated by voice. Larger and longer-billed than Western and Cassin’s Kingbird; also note paler brownish tail. Also very similar to White-throated (longer, forked tail) and Snowy-throated (dark mask) Kingbirds in some parts of South America.",
            "A relatively pale kingbird, medium-gray above and white below with a darker face mask. Primarily a Caribbean species with limited range in U.S.; found around the edge of dense woodland, especially near the coast. Also seen in more suburban areas. Often perches conspicuously on a snag, treetop, or powerline. Feeds on insects. Listen for its high-pitched twittering calls. Compare with Eastern and Loggerhead Kingbirds; Gray Kingbird has lighter gray upperparts, a thicker bill, and lacks white tail tips.",
            "Stocky and large-headed with a shaggy crest. Bill is long, straight, thick, and pointed. Powder blue above with white underparts and blue breast band. Females have additional rusty band across belly. Almost always solitary, perched along edges of streams, lakes, and estuaries. Flies along rivers and shorelines giving loud rattling calls. Hunts for fish by plunging headfirst into the water, either directly from a perch or hovering.",
            "Small kingfisher with disproportionately long bill. Dark glossy green above with white throat, collar, and spots on wings. Tail often held cocked up. White outer tail feathers spotted with green conspicuous in flight. Male has rufous breast; female breast white with spotted green double-collar. Found along rivers or ponds. Less conspicuous than some other kingfishers, often perching on overhanging branches close to water's surface. Low flight with quick wingbeats.",
            "Boldly marked black-and-white kingfisher with short, bushy crest and glossy all-dark bill. Superficially similar to Crested Kingfisher, but smaller, with a much more distinctly patterned head and breast and less erect crest. Frequently seen perched in pairs or small groups. Often hovers over water when seeking prey. Inhabits a wide range of waterside habitats, from lakes to estuaries to mangroves. Gives a variety of sharp notes, as well as dry trilling and rattling calls.",
            "Largest kingfisher in Americas with exceptionally enormous bill and raucous calls. Blue-gray with shaggy crest, white collar, and rufous belly. Male and female similar, but note different breast pattern: entirely rufous on male, while female has blue-gray band bordered by white. Often conspicuous, searching shallow water for fish from a prominent perch and chattering noisily when disturbed. Singles or pairs are also often observed flying high overhead and giving loud 'keck' calls. Nests in burrows excavated in banks, generally along watercourses.",
            "Large-headed, predominantly brown kingfisher with electric-blue back and wings, heavy orange bill, and snow-white patch from the throat through the breast. Common both near and away from water; frequently seen perched on fence posts and telephone lines near wetlands, lakes, agricultural fields, and clearings. Gives jarring, raptor-like descending trills and cackles, often in flight.",
            "Crisp small gull with very limited range; breeds on rocky cliffs on islands in the Bering Sea, from Alaska to Russia; winters on open ocean. Size and plumage most similar to Black-legged Kittiwake, but back is darker gray, yellow bill is shorter, legs are shorter and bright red, and underwing is darker gray. Nonbreeding birds have a dark smudge around eye and a thin gray ear patch. Young birds are similar to nonbreeding adults but with black bill, duller legs, and more contrasting wing pattern.",
            "Squat-looking bird with short legs and low-profile body. Adults are mostly sandy-brown with white belly, sometimes with blurry streaks on sides of breast. Look for bold head pattern, especially black mask and chest band. Throat color varies from yellow to white. Namesake horns on head are sometimes visible at close range. Juveniles can be confusing; they are messy-looking, grayish-brown with bold white spots and scallops on the upperparts. Note bill shape to help separate from sparrows or longspurs. Widespread in open habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Typically seen in flocks, sometimes mixed in with other open-ground songbirds, running along the ground in open areas with little to no vegetation. Listen for lovely jumbled song, as well as variable high-pitched calls when flying over.",
            "A medium-sized loon, common in western North America and across the Pacific to Japan. Dark overall and relatively short-billed for a loon, with a rounded crown and nape. Breeding plumage striking with gray head, white-checkered back, and thin white lines on sides of neck. Nonbreeding plumage is rather dark gray above with a clearly demarcated white throat and even border between gray and white on the neck. Diagnostic dark “chinstrap” is sometimes obvious but can be difficult to see at a distance, and is often absent on first-year birds. Especially similar to Arctic Loon, which overlaps mainly from Alaska to Japan. Pacific is subtly smaller-billed and usually holds its head horizontally. In breeding plumage, Pacific has a paler nape that shines silvery in the sunlight, and thinner white lines on the neck than Arctic. Breeds on lakes and ponds in the tundra. Winters mainly on nearshore ocean waters, sometimes in sheltered bays. Often in loose groups, especially where food is plentiful; sometimes mixes with other loon species. Rare but regular on inland reservoirs and lakes during migration and winter.",
            "Perhaps the most familiar duck in the Northwest, the Mallard is a large and heavy bird. Males have gray bodies with chestnut-brown breasts, white collars, iridescent-green heads, and yellow bills. Females are mottled brown-and-black with lighter brown heads and necks and yellow bills mottled with black. They have a black stripe running horizontally through the eye. Both sexes have orange feet and a blue speculum, or wing-patch, bordered in white on two sides, best seen in flight. From June to September, immatures and males, which are then in non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, look much like females.",
            "Streaked brown above and yellow below with distinctive black 'V' on breast. In flight, short wings and spiky tail with white outer feathers are apparent. Breeds in fields and grasslands throughout much of western North America, regularly as far east as Michigan. Winters in a wider range of open habitats, even agricultural fields and roadsides. Extremely similar to Eastern Meadowlark and best distinguished by voice: listen for musical gurgling song and 'chuk' calls. In winter, plumage looks paler and more washed-out than Eastern Meadowlark, with a less contrasting head pattern. Western is also more likely to be in flocks and areas with shorter grass (less pristine, extensive grasslands).",
            "Small diving duck with thin serrated bill. Breeding males have showy black-and-white crest, a couple zebra stripes on the white breast, and cinnamon-colored sides. Females are brown with a puffy crest and partly yellow bill. Looks slender and long-necked in flight, with very fast wingbeats. Widespread across much of North America, but usually only seen in pairs or small flocks. Nests in cavities near small ponds or marshes; especially fond of wooded swamps. In winter, usually found on calm bodies of water; almost never on the ocean. Sometimes mixes loosely with other duck species.",
            "Long-bodied duck with a thin bill and shaggy crest. Breeding males have a dark green head, brown breast, and gray sides. Females and immature males have a brown head and gray body. Bill is dull red. Separated from Common Merganser by thinner bill, shaggier crest, and slimmer shape overall. Dives to catch fish on large bodies of water, including freshwater lakes and coastal regions. Favors saltwater more than Common Merganser.",
            "A medium-sized songbird, a bit more slender than a thrush and with a longer tail. Mockingbirds have small heads, a long, thin bill with a hint of a downward curve, and long legs. Their wings are short, rounded, and broad, making the tail seem particularly long in flight. Mockingbirds are overall gray-brown, paler on the breast and belly, with two white wingbars on each wing. A white patch in each wing is often visible on perched birds, and in flight these become large white flashes. The white outer tail feathers are also flashy in flight.",
            "Common Nighthawks are medium-sized, slender birds with very long, pointed wings and medium-long tails. Only the small tip of the bill is usually visible, and this combined with the large eye and short neck gives the bird a big-headed look. Common Nighthawks are well camouflaged in gray, white, buff, and black. The long, dark wings have a striking white blaze about two-thirds of the way out to the tip. In flight, a V-shaped white throat patch contrasts with the rest of the bird’s mottled plumage.",
            "This relative of jays and crows is pale gray with a whitish face and black wings. Sexes are similar; juveniles are browner than adults. Found almost exclusively in coniferous forests at high elevations; feeds on pine cone seeds and stashes thousands of them in various places to eat later in the winter. Often found in flocks. Sometimes visits feeders. Similar in color to Canada Jay, but especially note bill shape: long, slender, and sharply pointed.",
            "The largest nuthatch in North America, with distinctive white face, black cap, and blue-gray upperparts. Also note rusty lower belly and undertail coverts. Females have a slightly paler crown than males. Fairly common and widespread, usually in mature woodlands with large trees. Creeps along tree trunks and branches, often upside-down. Sometimes joins mixed flocks with other songbirds. Visits feeders. Listen for insistent yammering calls. Some subtle variation across range, mainly in the darkness of the sides and back, width of the black crown, and vocalizations.",
            "The common oriole in the eastern U.S., wintering to northern South America. Adult males are stunning: bright orange with a black head and bold white wingbar. Females vary from yellowish to bright orange below, often with blotchy black on the head. Breeds in deciduous trees in open woodlands, forest edges, orchards, riversides, parks, and backyards. Listen for rich whistled song. Visits feeders with nectar and fruits. Females can be very difficult to distinguish from Bullock's Oriole, and hybrids do occur. Baltimore is usually brightest on the breast, not the face.",
            "A distinctive medium-sized yellow bird with a black head and breast, black flight feathers, and a red bill. In flight, the black band towards the tail tip is visible. Juvenile is duller overall with a white streaked throat and a darker bill. Often feeds on fruiting trees with a preference for figs in wooded gardens, groves, and open forests. The song is rich, fluty, and mellow. Calls include raspy, nasal notes that can sound like a croak.",
            "Small, slender oriole. Adult males are a unique rich chestnut-brown color with a black head. Females are dull yellow-green with white wingbars. Immature males are similar to females, but with a black throat and mask. Breeds in open woodlands, river edges, pastures with scattered trees, and brushy orchards. Visits feeders with nectar and fruits. Departs breeding grounds early and heads to wintering grounds in Mexico and Central America, where it can be found in any open or wooded habitat. Compare with female Hooded Oriole, which is larger and longer-tailed and has a narrower, more curved bill.",
            "This black-and-yellow oriole prefers dry habitats where yuccas are plentiful, often on steep hillsides. Males are particularly striking; look for the black back, head, and breast, bright white wingbar, and yellow shoulder. Females are duller grayish above, often retaining some black on the breast and throat. Young birds are quite dull; look for dull mottled streaking on the back. Listen for its whistled song, a rather fast series of clear notes. Feeds on insects, nectar, and fruit. Occurs from the southwestern U.S. to Oaxaca, where it can be found in mixed pine-oak woodland as well as dry desert hillsides.",
            "A small, somewhat chunky warbler, adult ovenbirds are noted for their olive-brown heads, necks, and backs, with a bold white ring around the eyes and a line of orange that runs down their heads flanked by a pair of black streaks. They have white underparts with black streaks on the chest, similar to the wood thrush, with a short tail and long pink legs. Males and females have similar color patterns.",
            "Large and conspicuous, gray-brown bird of saltwater habitats. Strictly coastal; rarely seen on inland lakes. Very long bill with pouch for scooping up fish. Forages mainly by diving on fish from above. Frequently cues into fishing activity looking for handouts. Often flies in long lines close to water's surface.",
            "A large white waterbird with a hefty bill and a yellow-orange throat pouch. Note the pink bare skin around eye that extends towards the bill. Young birds have browner overall plumage relative to adults with brown upper wings and a brown head. Legs are pink. In flight shows dark flight feathers which contrast with the rest of the wing. Often seen fishing cooperatively, swimming in a wide arc to round up the fish and then scoop them into their pouch.",
            "Drab grayish-brown flycatcher found in deciduous and mixed forests and edges. Nondescript overall with two pale wingbars; bill is usually mostly dark with only limited orange at the base. Note very long wings and larger size than Empidonax flycatchers. Typically seen on a high perch, occasionally sallying out to snatch an insect. Essentially identical to Eastern Wood-Pewee; averages darker overall with weaker upper wingbar, but reliably distinguished only by voice. Listen for buzzy tones, especially the “BREeerr” song.",
            "Eastern phoebes vary in overall head to tail length from 17.8 cm to 19 cm. Adults weigh 17 to 21 g and have wingspans of 26 to 28 cm. Eastern phoebes exhibit cryptic coloration with dull, brownish-gray coloration on their backs and tails, and slightly darker coloration on their heads. Their breasts and underbellies range in color from grayish-white during most of the year to pale yellow in the winter. They have no identifying wing bars and lack eye rings. The only visible difference between sexes is that males are slightly larger. Eastern phoebes have dark, broad-based beaks. The top bill turns downward slightly to end in a small hook and the lower bill has rictal bristles near the base. Rictal bristles function similarly to vibrissae in mammals, which helps eastern phoebes detect objects near them and navigate their environment.",
            "Slender and drab songbird of open country. Usually grayish above and streaked below, but some lack streaks in breeding season. Distinguished from similar-looking (unrelated) sparrows by thin bill and lanky appearance with long legs. Walks on the ground with jerky motions and frequently bobs tail. Flocks are often heard as they pass overhead or flush from a barren field; listen for sharp, high-pitched call notes and look for flashing white outer tail feathers. Song, given from a perch or in flight, is an often impressively lengthy series of repetitive, high-pitched notes.",
            "Eastern whip-poor-wills are characterized by long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Adults have mottled plumage. Their upperparts are grey, black, and brown in color; the lower parts are grey and black. Males have a white patch below the throat and white tips on the outer tail feathers; in the female, these parts are light brown.",
            "Chunky black-and-white seabird with very thick yellow and red bill. Orange feet. Named for the spikelike protrusion of black skin above the eye. Nonbreeding and immature birds have a darker gray face and duller bill. Nests in colonies on rocky islands or cliffs in Canada and Alaska; winters on open ocean. Only other seabird in range with such a thick bill is Tufted Puffin, which has an entirely black body.",
            "Large, glossy-black bird with a wedge-shaped tail. Larger than a crow with a longer, thicker bill. Distinctive shape in flight, with rather long, swept-back wings and long tail. Note smoother, steadier wingbeats compared with faster, choppier wingbeats of crows. Extensive range throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Found in a wide variety of habitats, including desert, coniferous forest, coastlines, sagebrush, tundra, and grasslands. Often solitary or in pairs, but can gather in small groups. Typical call is a loud, guttural croak, but makes an astonishing variety of other strange noises. Compare with Chihuahuan Raven in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, and with various large, all-dark crows and ravens in Europe and Asia.",
            "Typical, heavy-billed raven, but with the unusual addition of a white wedge on the back of the neck. Flight is powerful and heavy; sometimes soars. Found in a variety of habitats in rocky or mountainous country. Usually in pairs or small flocks; feeds by walking along the ground. Call is a rough “krrraw.” Larger than Pied Crow, with a heavier bill and much less white. Similar to Thick-billed Raven, but shorter-tailed, smaller-billed, and with a more extensive white patch on the neck.",
            "Adult males are striking and distinctive: mostly glossy black with bright orange flashes on the wings, tail, and sides. Females and young males are duller gray and olive with yellow patches instead of orange. Habitually flicks and fans tail while foraging for insects. Breeds in mature deciduous forests, often near water. Migrants can be found in any wooded habitat. Fairly extensive winter range throughout most of Middle America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Song is extremely variable.",
            "The head, neck, back, and wings of greater roadrunners are dark brown-black and heavily streaked with white, while the breast is mostly white. The eyes are bright yellow and there is a postocular streak of bare blue and red skin. A particularly notable feature is the crest of black feathers, which is raised or lowered at will. Overall, the body has a streamlined appearance, with a long tail that may be carried at an upward angle. The legs and beak are blue. The feet are zygodactylous, with two toes pointed forward and two toes pointed backward. The sexes are similar in appearance. Immature greater roadrunners lack the colorful postocular streaks and are more bronze in color.",
            "Black-masked bandit of open areas with some bushes and trees. Bold black, white, and gray pattern is distinctive; also note stout hooked bill. Usually seen singly or in pairs, often perched conspicuously on a treetop or utility wire. Fairly widespread in southern and western North America, but never abundant, and declining over much of range. Carnivorous habits make shrikes unique among passerines; they feed on rodents and small birds. Undulating flight; watch for white patches in the wings. May overlap with Northern Shrike in winter; Loggerhead is slightly smaller, darker, and lacks white around the eye.",
            "Thrush-sized bird; pale gray overall with black mask. In flight, watch for white patches in the wings. In areas of overlap, compare with other gray shrikes. Inhabits open habitats with scattered vegetation, from open forests to bogs and brushy meadows. Often seen on prominent perches, including power lines and short treetops, that offer perfect vantages for from which to spot prey. Carnivorous habits make shrikes unique among passerines, feeding on rodents and small birds. Vocalizations include bright short liquid trills and “gargling” phrases, often strung together into a repetitive song.",
            "One of North America's most sought-after sparrows due to its small breeding range and secretive habits. Breeds in extensive tall grasslands; winters in similar grassy habitats. Pale tan overall with crisp black streaking on breast. Warm buffy face is brightest to the rear of the eyebrow and broken up by thin black markings. Easy to see when perched, singing its high-pitched tinkling trill; otherwise shy and difficult to locate. Population is declining due to development of prime grassland breeding habitat.",
            "Evidence that not all sparrows are dull, Black-throated Sparrow is a sharp-dressed denizen of open, shrubby desert. Gray-brown overall with distinctive black-and-white face pattern, dark tail with white corners. Streakier juvenile shows a hint of adult's face pattern, especially white eyebrow. Typically found on or near the ground in pairs or small flocks. Tinkling song with short trills and chips.",
            "Small, drab sparrow of scrubby areas in western North America, from Alaska to Mexico. Slender and long-tailed, similar in shape and size to Chipping and Clay-colored Sparrows. Note the pale gray nape, pale lores, and plain facial pattern. Breeds mostly in sagebrush; winters in loose flocks in any brushy or grassy area, often with other sparrows. Song is a long series of buzzy, reedy notes mixed with trills; tones and long duration of song are unique.",
            "Small, slender, and incredibly cute sparrow. Plain grayish breast, rusty cap, and black eyeline in breeding season. Not as bright in winter, but still shows a brown cap and dark eyeline. Juveniles are extensively streaky. Common and widespread throughout most of North America. Usually found in open woodlands, scrubby areas, or even in suburban settings. Often gathers in flocks in fall and winter. Visits feeders. Frequently heard singing a fairly dry trill. Compare with similar Clay-colored, American Tree, and Brewer's sparrows, but look for Chipping Sparrow's gray rump and dark eyeline.",
            "Small, slender sparrow with short bill and long, narrow tail. Subtly patterned with pale gray and buff overall. Face usually looks crisp and clean. Most similar to Chipping and Field Sparrows, but note combination of white supercilium, plain lores, and buffy rump. Song is a series of low, insect-like buzzes. Breeds mostly in grasslands with shrubs; winters in any open, brushy, or weedy area.",
            "House Sparrows are actually large finches.They are usually seen in small to medium-sized groups, but may occur in huge numbers. The male has a conspicuous grey crown, black face and throat, and dark black and brown upperparts. The remainder of the under parts are pale grey-brown. When breeding, the black of the throat extends to the chest and upper belly. The bill also changes from brown to black. The female is slightly paler than the male and lacks the grey crown and black face, instead having a pale buff eye stripe. Young House Sparrows are similar to the adult female, but are duller with some mottling on the crown, and have a darker bill.",
            "Small, slender, blank-faced sparrow. Can be either gray or buffy overall, but always note small pink bill, plain face, and thin white eyering. Inhabits overgrown fields and other brushy areas in eastern North America. Often joins flocks of sparrows in winter. Can visit feeders, but less frequently than Chipping or American Tree sparrows. Song is a series of bell-like notes, accelerating like a dropped ping-pong ball.",
            "Large, dark sparrow with extensive geographic variation. Larger than Song Sparrow, and generally darker with thicker streaking. Four groups of subspecies: Red (only subspecies found in eastern U.S., but breeds to Alaska), Slate-colored (Rockies), Sooty (Pacific Northwest), Thick-billed (California). Habitat varies across range, but generally breeds in forests with thick understory, often with plenty of conifers. In winter, tends to occur in dense thickets. Forages mainly on the ground in search of seeds. Visits feeders.",
            "Grasshopper Sparrow is on the small side for a sparrow, with a distinctive compact shape. The head is large and flat-crowned, with a conspicuous bill. Tail is very short. Grasshopper Sparrow is a brown and tan bird with light streaking. The belly is white but the entire breast is unstreaked and buffy. The back is mottled tan, black, and chestnut, and isn’t as streaky as other sparrows. The face is relatively plain with a conspicuous white eyering. They often show a yellow spot between the eye and bill (the lore), and on the bend of the wing.",
            "Large sparrow that is largely restricted to the middle of North America. Breeds in boreal forest and shrubbery in the far north of central Canada, and winters in shrubby or weedy areas in the southern Great Plains. Adults have distinctive black face and pink bill. Immatures have plain brown face and splotchy black bib. White belly with dark streaks on sides. Dark crown feathers are beautifully edged with white. Visits feeders; occasionally strays east or west of normal range.",
            "A large-headed and thick-billed sparrow, found exclusively in weedy grasslands with sparse shrubs. Distinctive color combination of olive-green nape, rufous wings, and crisp black streaks below. Also note large pinkish bill and flat crown. Singing males perch conspicuously in the breeding season; otherwise very secretive, especially in migration and winter. Populations declining sharply, perhaps due to pesticide use and destruction of native grasslands. Listen for its extremely short song, easy to pass off as an insect: “ts-lick.”",
            "This strikingly beautiful sparrow is found in wet meadows with tall grass. Look for the bright orange-buff face with a silvery cheek, spotted purplish-gray nape, and crisp black streaking on buffy underparts. Secretive; difficult to see well unless a male is perched up singing. Most similar to Nelson's Sparrow but typically found in slightly drier habitats; also note white stripe down center of crown on LeConte's. Sings a dry, hissing trill with sharp introductory notes.",
            "A medium-sized sparrow with crisp patterning. Slightly smaller than Song Sparrow, with finer streaking on breast (like a pen-and-ink drawing vs. an oil painting). Also note thin pale eyering, bright buffy breast that contrasts with white throat and belly, and often peaked crown. Breeds in thickets and shrubby clearings, usually within mixed or coniferous forests. Can be found in any brushy or weedy habitat in migration and winter. Beware of juvenile Song Sparrows in late summer, which can look buffy and show finer streaks than adults. Infrequently visits feeders.",
            "This bright sparrow has multiple disjunct populations; inland breeders are generally brighter than coastal breeders. Atlantic birds have a duller buffy face and breast with blurry gray streaking; Interior birds are brighter orange with crisper black streaking. Similar to Saltmarsh Sparrow but shows less contrast between the face, throat, and breast and has a shorter blue-gray bill. Inland birds can be confused with LeConte's Sparrow but note clean gray nape and gray, not white, stripe in crown. Conspicuous when singing, otherwise secretive. Its song is a simple hiss like water sizzling in a frying pan. Winters in coastal marshes along most of Atlantic seaboard and Gulf Coast.",
            "A medium-sized, short-tailed sparrow. Extensive plumage variation across range, but always streaky. Usually shows distinctive yellow patch in front of eye, but this can be indistinct or absent on some individuals. Some populations in California and Baja have larger bills and more muted gray streaking; others are very dark and boldly streaked. “Ipswich” Sparrow on the Atlantic Coast is paler with unique buffy-pinkish tones. Almost always found in open areas, from meadows and hayfields to tundra and coastal dunes. Tends to be found in more open habitats than Song Sparrow; also smaller and shorter-tailed.",
            "The darkest sparrow found exclusively in wet saltmarshes with tall grass. Shares habitat with Saltmarsh and Nelson's Sparrows but Seaside is plainer and grayer overall. Plumage differs slightly among populations: Gulf Coast birds brighter, southern Florida birds show more distinct streaking below, Atlantic birds dullest. All populations have a contrasting white throat, yellow in front of eye, and a long bill. Perches conspicuously when singing, otherwise secretive, especially in winter. Rougher, buzzier song than Nelson's or Saltmarsh Sparrows: a few harsh introductory notes followed by a raspy sigh.",
            "One of the most common and widespread sparrows in North America. Fairly large with a long, rounded tail. Overall coarsely patterned with gray and brown, usually with more reddish-brown wings and tail. Look especially for thick brown streaks on the underparts and a broad dark mustache stripe. Significant variation in plumage geographically: relatively pale and rusty in the southwestern U.S.; blacker streaking in California; overall dusky in the Pacific Northwest. Larger, longer-tailed and usually more rusty than Savannah Sparrow. Found in a variety of scrubby habitats both near and far from human development, especially edges of fields, often near water. Listen for husky 'chimp' calls and melodic song with chips and trills.",
            "This common Eurasian species is a close relative of the House Sparrow. Slightly smaller than House Sparrow with entirely rufous cap, black and white cheek, and limited black in the throat. Males and females are similar. Typically found in noisy small flocks, often in more natural areas than concrete-loving House Sparrow; calls are often higher-pitched than those of House Sparrow, and has a slightly slower chatter. Feeds on seeds. Introduced to a small region in the central U.S. and southeast Australia.",
            "Large, drab, streaky sparrow of grasslands, second growth, and bare ground. Most distinctive in flight, when it flashes white outer tail feathers. Also note the thin white eyering and rufous shoulder (often hidden). Forages mainly on the ground. Song usually starts with a couple clear introductory notes, followed by a series of trills and chips.",
            "Large, long-tailed sparrow with striking head pattern. Adults have black and white stripes on the head, while immatures show brown and tan. Underparts are plain grayish without streaks. Bill color varies from yellow to pink, but always brighter than White-throated Sparrow. Breeds in brushy areas or thickets in open forest, often with conifers. In migration and winter, can be found in any brushy or weedy areas, often hopping on the ground. Visits feeders.",
            "Large, long-tailed sparrow. Usually shows a bold head pattern and contrasting white throat. Two morphs with different head colors: white-striped and tan-striped. Both morphs show a yellow patch in front of the eye, but it is more obvious on white-striped birds. Adults have a fairly plain gray-brown breast without bold streaks, but immatures can be quite streaky. Note the grayish bill, unlike White-crowned Sparrow. Breeds in coniferous or mixed forests, often near clearings. In migration and winter, can be found in woods, forest edge, thickets and shrubby fields. Whistled song often transcribed as 'Old Sam Peabody' or 'O Sweet Canada.' Visits feeders.",
            "A medium-sized iridescent blue-green glossy starling that lacks dark ear-patches and has greenish flanks and belly, giving it a more uniform appearance than the “blue-eared” starlings. Pairs and small groups occupy high-altitude grassland, Karoo, and savanna, including drier habitats than other glossy starlings. The species feeds on the ground and in trees on fruit and insects; often it scavenges from people. It gives a rolling “turrreaau” flight call and harsh “karrr” alarm notes. Similar “blue-eared” starlings differ from Cape Starling by being smaller and having blue-magenta flanks and belly that give them a less uniform appearance.",
            "Small and compact swallow, with quick flicking wingbeats. Brown above and white below, with a contrasting dark chest band. Note the relatively long, notched tail and narrow, pointed wings. Breeds in colonies; builds nest by tunneling into sandbanks. Can be seen over any open habitat including fields, marshes, and ponds, often in mixed flocks with other species of swallows. Compare with other small brownish swallows where overlaps occur in its extensive global range.",
            "A fairly large, colorful swallow. Usually easy to identify with its long, forked tail and dark rump. Iridescent navy-blue above with a rich orange throat and forehead. Underparts vary across range, from bright buffy-orange to whitish. Occurs in any open habitat, especially large fields and wetlands. Often seen foraging in flocks, sometimes mixed with other species of swallow. Typically nests close to human habitation; builds a muddy cup nest in a barn or under a dock. Listen for dry, scratchy “svit svit” calls. Note head and breast pattern and tail length to help separate from various similar species in Africa, Asia, and Australia (e.g., Welcome Swallow, Angolan Swallow, Pacific Swallow).",
            "Compact swallow with a short, square tail. In flight, looks slightly less angular than other swallows, with more rounded wings. Note pale buffy-orange rump, which separates Cliff from most other swallows in range. Also look for dark throat and pale forehead. Widespread and fairly common, especially in western North America. Breeds under bridges, overpasses, and culverts. Winters in South America. Compare especially with Cave Swallow, which has a paler throat and orange forehead.",
            "Tree Swallows are elegant birds with white undersides, iridescent blue-green backs, and moderately forked tails. Seen in profile, this swallow has a sharp line of demarcation between the dark of the head above the eye and the pure white of the rest of the face and underparts. In Washington, Tree Swallows are most likely to be confused with Violet-green Swallows, but Violet-green Swallows have white patches extending up the sides of the rump that can be seen in flight. The white on the faces of Violet-green Swallows extends above their eyes. Male and female Tree Swallows in adult plumage look similar to each other, but Tree Swallows are unique in that first-year females, although reproductively mature, have a different plumage from older birds. This plumage is similar to the juvenile plumage--non-iridescent brownish-gray above with a grayish-white belly. Juveniles have a grayish breast-band that first-year females lack. Juveniles could be mistaken for Bank Swallows, but the breast-band of Bank Swallows is more distinct than that of juvenile Tree Swallows.",
            "Breeding males are unmistakable: brilliant red with black wings and tail. Females and nonbreeding males are dull yellow-olive with dark wings (blacker on males, grayer on females). Compare with female Summer Tanager, which has a longer bill and less contrast between wing and body color. Breeds in mature deciduous forests, usually staying high in the canopy. Migrants are also usually found in mature woodlands. Winters in northern South America. Occasionally visits feeders in the spring, especially after periods of rain or cold weather. Listen for burry song, like an American Robin with a sore throat.",
            "Large tanager with a hefty bill. Adult males are completely red; immature males are dull yellow-olive with blotchy patches of red. Females are variable in color, ranging from pale dull yellow to brighter orange. Can be confused with female Scarlet Tanager; Summer has a longer, paler bill and less contrast between wing and body color. Also compare with dustier-looking, stouter-billed Hepatic Tanager. Breeds in mature forests, favoring mixed deciduous and pine in the southeastern U.S. and riparian corridors in the western U.S. and northern Mexico. Extensive winter range from Mexico to Bolivia, where it can be found in any wooded area. Often gives a short, descending rattle “pit-a-tuck.”",
            "Elegant seabird with extremely long wings and forked tail. Adults are pale gray with white cheek, black cap, and red bill and legs. Very similar to Common Tern; note shorter bill, shorter legs, gray belly, and paler gray wingtips with very limited dark tips. Young birds show partial black cap and black bill and legs; look for pale gray wingtips and stubbier legs to separate from Common Tern. Rarely seen away from breeding grounds on coastal islands or small ponds in the Arctic tundra. Migrates offshore, heading for wintering grounds in Southern Hemisphere.",
            "Small tern with an entirely black body in breeding plumage with silvery wings. In the winter, their body is whitish-gray and they are not as conspicuous, but note small size, rather dark gray wings and rump, and black 'helmet.' Breeds in colonies in freshwater marshes and ponds. Builds a floating nest of plant matter. In migration and winter, often found in flocks. Feeds on insects and small fish.",
            "Largest tern in the world; widespread but typically uncommon. Thick, bright-red bill is distinctive; most have small dark marking near the tip. Note solid black cap in summer which turns to black streaks in winter. Juveniles have V-shaped markings on the upperparts. Feeds by cruising over lakes, rivers, estuaries, and reservoirs looking for fish, then plunging to catch them. Smooth wingbeats, more gull-like than choppy flight of small-bodied terns. Very vocal, giving loud raucous screams. Compare especially with Royal Tern, which is slightly smaller and more slender, and has a thinner, more orangey bill.",
            "Medium-sized tern found on open ocean, beaches, and large lakes. Adults have pale gray body and black cap. Bill color differs by subspecies: most have red bill with black tip, but some Asian birds have all-black bills. First-years show dark outer primaries, dark shoulder, and black restricted to back of neck. Similar to Forster's, Arctic, and Roseate Terns. Separated from breeding Forster's Tern by entirely gray upperwings; nonbreeding Forster's shows black ear patch. Somewhat longer-billed and shorter-tailed than Arctic Tern, with paler body. Shorter-tailed and overall darker than gleaming white Roseate Tern. Often found in large flocks, especially in late summer. Gives a harsh screeching call 'KEEE-yurrrr.'",
            "Long-billed tern of the Pacific coast, from the U.S. to Chile. Pale gray above with shaggy black cap in breeding plumage; nonbreeding birds develop white forehead. Best field mark is the slender orange bill with a slight droop. Strictly coastal; commonly found on beaches and estuaries. Similar to Royal Tern but smaller and slimmer with a thinner bill. Harsh grating calls similar to other terns.",
            "Smaller than all the gulls, with thinner and more pointed bill. Distinguished from other terns by pale whitish wings and orange-based bill in summer, and isolated black ear patch in winter. Forages by circling and hovering over bays, ponds, and lakes, then dropping to snatch fish. Often rests on sandbars, piers, and other structures with other gull and tern species. Snappy, quick wingbeats and acrobatic in flight.",
            "Tiny tern with quick flicking wingbeats. A real beach bum, rarely straying far from sand, both on the coast and along inland rivers and lakes. Breeding adults have yellow bill, stumpy yellow feet, white forehead, and black cap. Nonbreeding and immatures have a black bill, blackish nape, and dark shoulder bar, but still always identifiable by size and quick wingbeats. Often seen with other terns. Listen for shrill high-pitched calls.",
            "Large, long-tailed sparrow with unique color pattern: gray body, fairly bright greenish wings and tail, rufous crown, and white throat. Favors disturbed areas in montane forest and open slopes for breeding. In winter, usually found in dense thickets or mesquite in desert washes. Forages on the ground or in dense shrubs primarily for seeds and insects. Rarely visits feeders. Listen for unique nasal call note.",
            "Longer-tailed and slightly larger than a robin. Rich rufous upperparts and heavy dark streaking on whitish underparts. Yellow eyes. Often skulks in thick vegetation in scrubby fields and forest edges. Mimics other species in its song, delivering a complex string of paired phrases.",
            "The smallest thrasher; crisp black streaking on underparts unlike most other western thrashers. Grayish brown with buffy wash on belly and sides and thin white wingbars. Long tail. Small, slightly downcurved bill. In flight, look for white corners on tail. True to its name, shows a strong affinity for sagebrush. Singing males perch conspicuously, otherwise furtive, running around on the ground in search of insects. Song is a long, loose series of musical chirps and whistles.",
            "Small vireo with distinctive black head and bold white spectacles surrounding a red eye. Otherwise greenish above with white underparts, yellowish sides and two yellow wingbars. Females and immatures slightly duller than adult males. Found in shrubby habitats with oak and juniper, especially on hillsides. Migrates south to Mexico for the winter. Endangered; populations especially threatened by Brown-headed Cowbird nest parasitism.",
            "Attractive, colorful vireo with thick white spectacles. Note dark blue-gray head, yellowish sides, and bold white wingbars. Breeds in forested areas, typically mixed coniferous and deciduous. Migrants can be found in any wooded area, often in flocks with other small songbirds. Winters from the southeastern U.S. to Central America. Blue-headed is the brightest of the 'Solitary Vireo' complex, and usually identifiable by range alone. Compare especially with Cassin's Vireo on the wintering grounds, but note Blue-headed is more colorful and contrasty. Especially look for contrast between the dark gray face and white throat. Some birds are best left unidentified. Song is sweeter and slower than other vireos in breeding range.",
            "Small, short-tailed, most similar to Warbling Vireo, but brighter: look for yellow wash on underparts, brightest on throat and undertail, and dark line through the eye that connects to base of bill. Dull individuals can be very difficult to distinguish from Warbling Vireo, but Warbling usually brightest yellow on flanks, not throat. Similar to Red-eyed Vireo but with shorter bill and yellower below. Breeds in deciduous forests, especially areas with younger trees including birches or aspens. Migrates through a variety of wooded and brushy habitats; winters in Central America. Song nearly identical to Red-eyed Vireo. Feeds on insects; especially caterpillars.",
            "Plain olive-green above and whitish below with no wingbars. Red eye of adults is not always easy to see; immatures have brown eyes. Dark stripe through and above eye. Larger and thicker-billed than warblers. Breeds in mature deciduous forest. Often sings nearly nonstop throughout the day; listen for repetitive musical phrases coming from the treetops. Often with flocks of chickadees and warblers during migration. Winters in South America, where it could be confused with the very similar Chivi Vireo. Best distinguished by voice.",
            "Rather nondescript vireo with a blank face. Pale grayish-olive overall with a faint white eyebrow, darker grayish crown, and pale yellowish wash on the sides. Often confused with Philadelphia Vireo; note Warbling shows brightest color on sides (not throat) and fainter dark eyeline (especially indistinct in front of the eye). Warbling is also longer-tailed and has a slightly longer, thinner bill than Philadelphia. Scratchy warbling song is heard from treetops, particularly in riparian areas and cottonwoods. Migrants and wintering birds can be found in any wooded habitat, as far south as Central America.",
            "A small, active vireo of dense shrubbery. Distinctive yellow spectacles contrast with gray head. Also look for two white wingbars, green back, and yellow sides. Adults have white eyes; juveniles have darker gray eyes. Occurs in dense second growth, forest edge, and thickets; more often heard than seen. Listen for the variable, scratchy 'chick-burio-chick' song. Primarily occurs in the southeastern U.S., wintering into northern Central America and the Caribbean. Compare with duller olive Thick-billed Vireo in the Caribbean, and plainer Bell's Vireo in the U.S. and Mexico.",
            "Stocky, brightly-colored vireo with yellow throat and spectacles. Olive upperparts and gray wings with two bold white wingbars. Breeds in mature deciduous forests in eastern North America, often near water. Usually seen singly, high in the canopy. Typical vireo song of short, repeated phrases; Yellow-throated is burry and slow, like a Blue-headed with a sore throat. Thick, slightly hooked bill helps separate this species from Pine Warbler, which has similar plumage. Winters in Central and northern South America.",
            "Breeding males are distinctive with dark reddish-brown cap and sides, along with buffy nape. Two bold white wingbars. Females and fall birds are duller; most show at least some chestnut coloring on sides. Dullest birds are similar to Blackpoll and Pine Warblers; look for streaks on back, well-defined wingbars, and cleaner greenish-yellow head and neck. Prefers conifers during migration, but can be found in any woodland. Breeds in the boreal forest. In most of U.S. , only seen during migration. Winters in Central and South America. Listen carefully for extremely high-pitched, squeaky-wheel song, similar to a fast Black-and-white Warbler.",
            "Distinctive warbler with bold black-and-white stripes over entire body. Adult males have black throat and cheek; females and immatures have white throat and paler cheek. Creeps along branches like a nuthatch, searching for insects. Breeds in mature deciduous or mixed forests; winters in a wider variety of wooded habitats as far south as northern South America. Listen for high pitched “squeaky-wheel” song. Breeding male Blackpoll Warbler is potentially confusing, but note different behavior and face pattern.",
            "Striking warbler with vastly different male and female plumages. Males are unique deep blue above with black face and sides and white belly. Females are plain brownish-olive with dingy buffy underparts and subtle face pattern. Always look for small white patch on the wing, lacking only on the dullest immature females. Breeds in the understory of mixed forests, favoring hills with dense vegetation. Found in nearly any wooded or shrubby habitat during migration. Winters primarily in the Caribbean. Listen for lazy buzzy song, usually a series of notes with a final long buzz.",
            "Small, yellow warbler found in scrubby or cut-over habitats with some large trees, including field edges or powerline cuts. Yellow overall with black line through eye. Blue-gray wings with two whitish wingbars; sharply pointed bill. Adult males brighter than females and immatures. Two-note buzzy song sounds rather insect-like. Winters in Central America. Hybridizes with Golden-winged Warbler.",
            "Spiffy warbler found in boggy areas. Blue-gray above and yellow below with distinctive yellow spectacles and necklace of black streaks. Legs are pale orange. Females show fainter necklace than males. Typically found in low vegetation, especially wet woods and thickets. Nests on the ground. Feeds on insects. One of the longest-distance migrant warblers; winters in South America.",
            "Small warbler with sharp bill that is very slightly downcurved. Plumages variable. Bright adult males are yellow below with black streaks, orange cheek patch, and white patch on wing. Dullest immature females are entirely gray with indistinct streaking below, usually with a hint of paler neck sides and greenish edges to wing feathers. Breeds in boreal forest of far northern U.S. and Canada. Winters in the Caribbean and Central America. Even in migration, shows a heavy preference for spruce trees.",
            "Brilliant sky-blue warbler of the high canopy. Prefers mature deciduous forest, either in riparian areas or dry mountain ridge-tops. Tends to stay high in the canopy; thus, can be difficult to see blue color. From below, look for white throat and belly, thin necklace, and dark streaks on sides. Female is a unique muted turquoise with pale eyebrow and blurry streaks on sides. Immature birds show yellow wash on underparts. All plumages have bold white wingbars. Easiest to detect in spring and summer by its loud buzzy song, similar to Black-throated Blue but usually richer and more distinctly three-parted; much lower-pitched than Blackburnian Warbler. Winters primarily on the east slope of the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia.",
            "Breeding birds show yellow cap, black triangle under eye, streaked back and reddish-brown sides. Looks remarkably different in fall with distinctive lime green above and gray below with bold white eyering. Breeds mainly in secondary forests, especially areas with large shrubs and young trees. Does well in disturbed habitats, particularly power line cuts and areas that have been logged. Forages for insects. Winters in Central America.",
            "This gem of a warbler is in precipitous decline over much of its range. Distinctive if seen well; note black-and-white face pattern with yellow crown and large yellow patch on wing. Female is a washed-out version of male. Frequently hybridizes with Blue-winged Warbler. Found in shrubby habitats near the edge of taller forest, often close to water. Sings a high-pitched buzzy song usually 3-4 notes with first note highest, but variable; occasionally identical to Blue-winged Warbler but typically higher and finer. Feeds on insects.",
            "Delicately beautiful small warbler with a greenish back, lemon-yellow underparts, a cinder-gray head, and bright white eyebrow stripes. Somewhat similar to Yellow-bellied Warbler, but note yellow instead of white throat. Forages actively in the upper levels of broadleaf and mixed montane forest, often in open patches. Sometimes descends to lower elevations in the non-breeding season, often turning up in foothill forest edges and gardens. Song is a high-pitched “tchi-tchi-cheeseewee-cheeseewee.” Calls are high, thin double notes.",
            "Shy warbler of deciduous forest with thick understory. Often found in swampy areas or near slow-moving streams. Bright yellow below with olive back. Telltale black mask set off by yellow spectacles and throat. All plumages show face pattern; adult males boldest with black crown, females and immatures duller with grayish or olive crown. In the breeding season, more often heard than seen. Song is a series of 4-8 loud, rich, rolling notes 'preet, preet, preet, preet.' Can perch high when singing, otherwise stays near the ground.",
            "Breeding males are striking and unmistakable: especially look for white wing patch, head pattern, and thick black streaks on underparts. Females and immatures are less obvious and might be mistaken for Canada Warbler, but combination of gray head, yellow underparts, white wingbars, and at least some dark streaks on the flanks is distinctive. Always look for tail pattern from below: basal half is white, tip is black. Breeds in coniferous forests, especially with dense understory. Migrants and wintering birds can be found in any wooded area or edge. Winters primarily in Central America and the Caribbean.",
            "Robust warbler found near the ground in thick vegetation. Yellow below with blue-gray head and olive back. Adult males show black chest patch. Females are paler gray on the head; immatures are more olive-toned with a yellowish throat. Breeds in brushy, weedy clearings within mixed or coniferous forest. Often favors raspberry thickets. Tends to stay hidden in low vegetation, so can be difficult to see. Listen for its rolling song, “churry churry churry chew.” Most similar to MacGillivray’s Warbler, but little range overlap, and Mourning has somewhat shorter tail and lacks bold white eye-arcs. Also frequently confused with Common Yellowthroat, especially in fall, but Mourning is larger, with heftier pinkish bill, and brighter yellow underparts.",
            "One of the most common and widespread warblers; often the core member of mixed warbler flocks during migration, especially early in spring and late in fall. Two main populations: “Audubon’s” breeds mainly in the mountains of the western U.S. and into British Columbia; “Myrtle” breeds from the eastern U.S. across Canada to Alaska. All plumages show a bright yellow rump and yellow on the sides. Most “Audubon’s” have a yellow throat, but dull immature females can be off-white. “Myrtle” Warblers have a white throat that wraps around below the cheek. Both subspecies breed in coniferous or mixed forests, often near clearings or edges. In migration and winter, found in any woodland or open shrubby area, including coastal dunes, fields, parks, and residential areas. Often sallies out from a conspicuous perch to snatch insects. Also eats berries in the winter. Calls frequently: a flat “check” (Myrtle) or rising “chit” (Audubon’s). Another distinctive sedentary population, surely a separate species, occurs very locally in the highlands of Guatemala: Goldman’s Warbler. Males are strikingly black overall, and show a mostly yellow throat with white corners.",
            "Small warbler with sharply pointed bill. Look for gray head, white eyering, yellow underparts (including throat), and olive upperparts. Sometimes pumps tail. Two disjunct breeding populations are very similar in appearance. Breeds in coniferous or mixed forests, often near clearings, second-growth, or bogs. In migration and winter, tends to be found in patchy woodland or brushy areas, including field edges and thickets. Winters primarily in Mexico. Listen for its loud chipping song, broken into two parts. Compare dull immature Nashville with Virginia’s Warbler; Nashvilles always have greenish wings. Also sometimes mistaken for larger gray-headed warblers like Mourning or Connecticut, but Nashville is much smaller, shorter-tailed, and sharper-billed.",
            "Nondescript warbler, generally olive-colored overall, but different populations vary from grayer to brighter yellow. Overall very plain and unmarked, but note short darkish line through eye and thin pale eye arcs. Forages for insects in scrubby areas, woodland edge, and thickets. Namesake orange crown is very difficult to see, and usually only a faint wash at best. More common in western North America, from Alaska to Mexico, where populations are brighter yellow-green. Birds in eastern North America are scarcer and drabber, often with a more contrasting grayish head. Bright yellow undertail coverts help separate Orange-crowned from the similarly drab Tennessee Warbler.",
            "Subtly patterned brown-and-yellow warbler, known for constantly bobbing its tail. Often forages on the ground, unlike most other warblers. Breeding plumage shows a rufous cap. In fall and winter, look for pale eyebrow and dark line through the eye, diffuse streaks on underparts, and bright yellow undertail coverts. Two populations: “Western” is browner overall, brightest on the undertail coverts; “Yellow” is more suffused with yellow overall; they overlap extensively in range, especially during fall migration. Breeds in bogs and clearings in the boreal forest. In migration, found in a variety of open, shrubby habitats. One of the more common warblers wintering in the southern U.S.; also winters in the Caribbean and Yucatan Peninsula.",
            "A medium-sized, rather robust and long-tailed warbler, with a noticeably stout bill. Variable plumage, from bright adult males with extensive yellow throat to extremely dull grayish-brown immature females. Always look for two white wingbars, diffuse streaking on the sides of the breast, large bill, and long narrow tail with a shallow notch. Well-named: almost always found in pine trees throughout the year. In spring and summer, listen for loud musical trill (compare with Chipping Sparrow and Dark-eyed Junco). Occasionally visits feeders, especially for suet. A short-distance migrant, wintering entirely in the United States.",
            "Small warbler, yellow overall with black streaks on sides and unique face pattern. Upperparts are duller olive. Reddish streaks on back are distinctive, but can be difficult to see or absent on immatures. Long tail is often pumped up and down, but not as consistently as Palm Warbler. Forages for insects in a range of shrubby habitats, from cedar-studded fields to regenerating woods to mangroves in Florida. Winters in Florida and the Caribbean.",
            "The Prothonotary Warbler is a large, heavy-bodied warbler with a big head and bill. It has shorter legs and a shorter tail than other warblers. Its bill is heavier and longer than most warblers. The Prothonotary Warbler is bright golden yellow with blue-gray wings and tail and a yellow-olive back. Its beady black eye stands out on its solid yellow face. Seen from below, it has white under the tail. Females are often paler yellow than males.",
            "Shy and difficult to see in deciduous forest with dense understory, often near water. Plain buffy-brown coloration with rufous crown and dark eyeline. Also note disproportionately large, sharp, pinkish bill and pink legs. Shimmies tail side-to-side as it slowly forages on the forest floor, investigating fallen leaf litter for insects. Fairly restricted breeding range in the southeastern U.S.; winters primarily on the Yucatan peninsula and in the Caribbean. Listen for loud, sweet song, similar to Louisiana Waterthrush but without the complex ending.",
            "Tiny, greenish warbler that breeds in boreal forest. Breeding males have lime-green back, pale blue-gray head, and dingy whitish underparts. Females and immatures generally show more yellow overall, but still dull. Note thin dark line through the eye, paler eyebrow, and whitish undertail coverts. Most similar to Orange-crowned Warbler. Look for cleaner, unstreaked breast and white (not yellow) undertail coverts. Loud song for such a small bird; usually three-parted series of accelerating chips. Often found around flowering trees during migration. Winters in Central and South America.",
            "Small, active, bright yellow warbler. Most birds (adults of both sexes and young males) have a black cap; young females lack this feature. Also note the rather long, narrow tail that is actively flipped around while foraging. Extensive breeding range across northern and western North America; more common in the west than east. Prefers dense thickets, especially with willows and alders. Winters primarily in Mexico, extending as far south as Panama. Migrants and wintering birds are found in any brushy wooded habitat. Listen for husky chip notes. Compare with Yellow Warbler, but note Wilson’s is smaller, smaller-billed, and has a relatively longer, thinner tail.",
            "A plain warbler dressed in subtle shades of olive, brown, and buff. Note black and tan stripes on head and long, sharp bill. Pinkish legs. Skulky, often seen in the understory, probing clumps of dead leaves in search of insects. Breeds in mature deciduous forests, especially on steep dry slopes. Winters primarily in Middle America and the Caribbean, where it can be found in a wider variety of forested habitats. Listen for its dry, insectlike trill that is very similar to Chipping Sparrow. Appearance most similar to Swainson’s Warbler; distinguished by head pattern (Swainson’s has a rufous crown, Worm-eating has a striped head) and habits (Swainson’s usually found on the ground, Worm-eating in low understory).",
            "Typically yellow overall, but some immatures can be almost completely gray. Most males have reddish-brown streaks below; females are plainer and duller yellow. Always looks uniform and plain-faced, with rather stout bill for a warbler. Favors brushy habitats near water, often foraging in shrubs fairly low to the ground. Common and widespread throughout North America; winters in Central and northern South America. “Mangrove” Yellow Warbler, currently considered a subspecies, is found in mangroves and nearby brush from Mexico to Ecuador. Males have a distinctive reddish-brown head.",
            "Brown-and-white denizen of dense vegetation near water. Look for off-white underparts with dark streaks (often with a noticeable yellowish wash) and a whitish eyebrow. Stays on or near the ground, constantly bobbing its rear end up and down. During the breeding season, favors thickets, dense bogs, or alder swales around slow-moving water. Winters primarily in Middle America and the Caribbean, extending into northern South America (further south than Louisiana Waterthrush). Very similar to Louisiana Waterthrush, but usually more yellowish base color below, duller legs, and narrower off-white eyebrow. Also look for small streaks on the throat (clean white on Louisiana). Best distinguished by song: a loud, two- or three-parted descending series of chips. Call note very similar to Louisiana: a loud, metallic chip.",
            "Brown-and-white denizen of bubbling streams and brooks. Look for white underparts with dark streaks, light buffy wash on the rear flanks, and bold white eyebrow. Stays on or near the ground, constantly bobbing its rear end up and down. Males sometime perch up high to sing. A very early migrant: arrives on the breeding grounds in eastern North America before most other warblers have even dreamed of starting migration, and arrives back on the wintering grounds as early as July or August. During the breeding season, favors fast-moving streams with lots of rocks to hop on. In the northern parts of its range, often in steep hemlock-lined ravines. Winters primarily in Middle America and the Caribbean, where it’s slightly less picky about habitat, and can be found around slower-moving water. Very similar to Northern Waterthrush, but whiter base color below, brighter pink legs, and broader white eyebrow. Also look for clean white throat (usually streaked on Northern). Best distinguished by song: several piercing clear whistles followed by a complex jumble of notes. Call note very similar to Northern: a loud, metallic chip.",
            "Plump, smooth-plumaged bird with a sleek crest and white and yellow markings on wings. Mostly clean gray with brighter rusty wash on the face. Look for rich rufous undertail. Breeds in open coniferous forests at high latitudes across the Northern Hemisphere. Winter range depends on fruit crops; sometimes descends much further south in large numbers. Often found in flocks feasting on fruiting trees like crabapple and mountain ash. Listen for their ringing trills, often given while flying overhead. Compare with Cedar Waxwing in North America and Japanese Waxwing in Asia; Bohemian is larger and grayer, with a different wing pattern and no yellow on the belly.",
            "Cedar Waxwings are sleek, masked birds with unusual red, waxy deposits at the tips of their secondary feathers. They are cinnamon-colored, with grayish wings and tails and yellow terminal tail-bands. They have distinctive crested heads, black throats, and black masks lined with white. Their bellies have a yellowish tinge, and their undertail coverts are white. Juveniles are mottled gray-brown, and have black masks and yellow tail-bands. The red feather-tips increase in number and size as the birds age. The only bird in Washington that could be confused with a Cedar Waxwing is a Bohemian Waxwing. Bohemians are larger and grayer than Cedars, without the yellow tinge underneath. They have rufous undertail coverts and white-and-yellow wing markings that Cedar Waxwings lack.",
            "Inconspicuous and uncommon woodpecker of coniferous forests, particularly spruces, often at high elevations (especially in the Rockies). Prefers recently burned areas or bogs with many dead trees. Distinctive habit of flaking bark off trees in search of grubs; behavior shared only by Black-backed Woodpecker. Generally dark with barred flanks and subtle white spots on wings and back. Face is black with white stripes above and below the eye and white speckles on the forehead. Eastern birds darker than western birds. Males show yellow patch on crown; sexes otherwise alike. Most similar to Black-backed Woodpecker but American Three-toed always shows some white on back and more white on head. Listen for soft, hollow 'pweek' call and slow drumming that fades at the end.",
            "Large, unmistakable woodpecker. Mostly black, with red crest and bold white stripes on head and neck. Flies with deep, rowing wingbeats, almost like a crow but more irregular; also look for mostly white underwings and white patches on upperwing. Pairs inhabit mature deciduous or coniferous forests with large trees. Makes large oval-shaped holes in decaying trees to search for insects. Listen for slow resonant drumming and loud clucking calls. Occasionally visits feeders in appropriate habitat, especially fond of suet.",
            "Medium-sized woodpecker that is not well named; rarely is the slight red wash on the belly visible! Instead, note the black-and-white barring on the back and wings, plain buffy breast and face, and red nape. On adult males, look for the red extending onto the crown. In flight, look for the white rump. Found in forested and suburban areas, typically preferring deciduous trees. Slowly expanding its range northward. Visits feeders, especially for suet. Nests in cavities.",
            "Red-cockaded Woodpeckers are small woodpeckers with short, straight bills. Despite their name, they are largely black and white, with a large, bright-white cheek patch and a bold black malar stripe forming the lower border of the cheek. Males have a tiny, nearly invisible red streak (“cockade”) at the upper border of the cheek. The back has strong horizontal black-and-white bars.",
            "Red-headed woodpeckers are sexually monomorphic. This means that males and females look exactly the same. They have bright red heads, necks, throats and shoulders. Their wings and tail are bluish-black. They have a white belly and a large square area of white on their rump. Their bills are long and chisel shaped, which is important for drilling into trees. Young red-headed woodpeckers look similar to adults, but their heads and necks are buffy-brown instead of red.",
            "Tiny woodpecker, common and widespread across much of North America. Black-and-white plumage is nearly identical to the larger Hairy Woodpecker. Focus on the bill: Downy has a very short bill, much shorter than the length of the head. Also note the small black markings on the white outer tail feathers. Pacific population has smaller white spots on the wing and a grayer body than Eastern birds. Occurs in any wooded habitat, though western birds are more restricted to riparian areas. Often forages on smaller branches than Hairy Woodpecker. Familiar visitor to backyard feeders, especially fond of suet. Calls include a soft “pik!” and descending rattle, weaker than Hairy Woodpecker.",
            "Long-tailed, rather slender wren. Dark brown above and pale grayish below with whitish eyebrow. Slender bill is slightly decurved. Favors dry scrubby areas, thickets in open country, and open woodlands near rivers and streams. Also at home in gardens, residential areas, and parks in cities and suburbs. Song is variable, but usually includes high-pitched buzzes and musical trills.",
            "Large wren, with bold white eyebrow and dense spots on the breast. Aptly named, this wren rarely strays from desert scrub or coastal sagebrush scrub. Builds large, oval nest of sticks. Listen for harsh, grating call.",
            "Bold white eyebrow. Warm brown above, buffy-orange underparts. Slightly decurved bill. Tail is about as long as body and often cocked up. Usually in hiding in dense vegetation, tangled understory, or brush piles in forested areas. Nests in peculiar places around backyards, such as tucked in a drainpipe or grill. Occasionally feeds on suet or mealworms at feeding stations. Listen for loud, ringing song and variety of calls. Unlike House Wren they are not migratory and stay nearby their breeding grounds year-round.",
            "At home in suburbs, parks, rural farmland, and other open areas with thick tangles. In the breeding season, it is often singing its effervescent song from the top of a bush or fence post. Plumage doesn't show much contrast: plain brown overall, slightly paler below, with some dark barring on the wings and tail. Lacks white eyebrow. In winter they are more secretive, preferring brushy tangles, thickets, and hedgerows.",
            "Habitat is the best clue for identifying this wren; rarely strays from cattail marshes and rushes for breeding. Migrants occasionally move into wet fields. Often difficult to see well as it skulks through grasses. Its plumage is rather bright rufous with darker brown cap, contrasting whitish eyebrow and throat, and black-and-white stripes on back. Overall darker and more contrasting than similar Sedge Wren.",
            "True to its name, prefers rocky areas, especially rocky slopes. Often perches conspicuously and bobs up and down. Pale grayish wren with whitish throat, buffy sides, and long, slightly decurved bill. Tiny speckles on back and wings like grains of sand. Undertail coverts barred black and white. Paler overall than Canyon Wren with a pale, buffy belly. Listen for its ringing vocalization. Sexes alike.",
            "Tiny, short-tailed, plain-brown wren with a huge voice. Subtly patterned, with indistinct pale eyebrow and diffuse dark barring on flanks and wings. Constantly keeps tail cocked at an angle. Found in a variety of forested habitats, but always prefers wetter areas with thick tangles, often around treefalls and moss. Darker, smaller, and shorter-tailed than House Wren. Incredibly beautiful song is a long series of musical whistles and trills; an unmistakable and common sound in northern forests. Call is a dry, low 'chimp' remarkably similar to Song Sparrow.",
            "Small warbler, dull olive overall with intense yellow throat. Adult males have black mask bordered above by a white band. Females and immatures are duller but always have contrasting yellow throat and undertail coverts. Common and widespread breeder throughout North America. Found in shrubby wet areas, including marshes, forest edges, and fields. Often hides in thick vegetation, but males often perch conspicuously when singing. Listen for ringing “witchity-witchity-witchity” song and low, harsh call notes. Very short, rounded wings, which equates to it being a short-distance migrant: winters from the southern U.S. to Central America."
